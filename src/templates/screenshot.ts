I’m Author name, a moderator of the Daybreak feed. Thank you for being a valued member of the
Daybreak community! I’m just writing to remind you about our guidelines regarding taking
screenshots of content in Daybreak’s peer support community after a post on the [insert date]. We
appreciate that the content our members share is valuable, but it&#39;s important that members&#39; personal
experiences are not captured or shared outside of Daybreak&#39;s peer support community.
As is mentioned in our guidelines, which you can access here https://hellosundaymorning.org/terms-
of-use-daybreak/, community members are asked to:

● Respect the privacy and confidentiality of other members by not sharing content from
Daybreak outside of the community. This includes capturing screenshots or taking photos of
your peer-to-peer feed and copying and sharing people’s messages outside of Daybreak.
Please take this as a gentle reminder about avoiding taking screenshots of content in Daybreak’s
peer support community. Thanks so much for your understanding!
Best wishes,
Author name
