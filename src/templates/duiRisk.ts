I’m [Author Name], a moderator of Daybreak’s peer support feed. Thanks for being a valued member of the Daybreak community. I just read your comment about [insert comment about share] and wanted to check in with you and offer you some support on your alcohol change journey. There are a number of resources available to help you reduce the risk of harm to [yourself and/or others].


We recommend keeping this number handy and contacting the National Alcohol and Other Drug hotline on 1800 250 015. They provide a free and confidential service for people needing information, support and referrals for those affected by alcohol and other drug use. Their service is available any time of the day or night, 24/7. 

If located outside Australia, contact your local emergency service, local health service, doctor or crisis service for advice and support.

Just so I know you’re ok, please let me know when you have received my message.

Best wishes,
