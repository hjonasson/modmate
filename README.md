# Modmate. An assistant for forum moderation.

This repo has an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server serving a single web page. That page has a form where forum moderators can paste a forum message, get it flagged (or not) and get a tailored response back. That tailored response is created using prompts and Google's Gemini.
